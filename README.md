# README

This is meant to be a simple example document that is easily readable so that it can be used as a learning tool to get up adn running wioth groff very quickly.

I come form using markdown as well as LaTeX so this document is written with the point of view of someone looking for an alternative to LaTeX for proffesional looking documents.

I also jsut wanted to experiment with groff because I like retro computing and typesetting and the idea of using a typeseetting system that ise older than me to make documents just excites me a little bit.

This document will not go into depth on advanced features of groff like macros but I will attempt to address most features that can be found in markdown.
